## 🤝 How to Contribute

### 🐛 Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, encounter an unexpected behavior, or have a suggestion for improvement:

1.  **Check Existing Issues:** Before opening a new issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gab23r/xplor/issues) to see if the issue or suggestion already exists.
2.  **Create a New Issue:** If not found, create a new issue with a clear, descriptive title.
3.  **Provide Context:**
      * **For Bugs:** Include the version of Python, Polars, and the solver you are using (Gurobi/OR-Tools). Provide clear, minimal steps and code to reproduce the unexpected behavior.
      * **For Features:** Clearly outline the use case and the benefits of the proposed feature.

### 💻 Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

2.  **Clone** your fork locally and navigate to the directory.
